# MonocleEngine
A 2D open source framework built off of Microsoft XNA, used in games like TowerFall.
Originally created by MaddyThorson, but put on github since their repos now 404's because bitbucket's repo is gone. 

My repo is simply some modifications slowly that I will have made to it, for utility reasons, simply.
